Salary was good and day to day work didn't get repetitive because of all the different clients and tasks that would fill in the days. Having good work colleagues was something that made the difference between the job being enjoyable as opposed to boring.","The bank uses a target/reward system to encourage employees to work more efficiently. However, I found that this 'target' system, where each employee was set a target number and to achieve their assigned target, they would need to be getting referrals or setting up services for clients. Products that held numerical rewards for points included new accounts, loans, credit cards, etc. I found this system was good in the sense it prompted employees to continually inform customers of new deals or products on offer, however, it also culminated in a lot of pressure to maintain weekly targets and essentially I felt it made a lot of employees treat customers like numbers, which defeats the focus Commonwealth Bank pushes so hard for, being number one in customer service.
